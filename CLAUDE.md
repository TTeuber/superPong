## 🏗️ Architecture Details

### Design Pattern
The project uses a **component-based architecture** with clear separation and single responsibility:
- **Entities**: Game objects (Paddle, Ball, PowerUp, Obstacle)
- **Systems**: Specialized game logic managers (State, Menu, Aiming, Collision, Player, Renderer, Input, AI, Particles)
- **Utils**: Shared utilities (Constants, Math)

### Refactored Architecture (June 2025)
The codebase was refactored to improve scalability and maintainability:
- **Reduced game.py from 514 lines to 227 lines** (>50% reduction)
- **Extracted specialized systems** for better separation of concerns
- **Improved testability** with isolated system responsibilities
- **Enhanced scalability** for adding new features

### Technical Decisions Made

1. **Pygame Choice**: Selected for 2D graphics and rapid prototyping
2. **Vector Physics**: Using custom Vector2 class for smooth ball movement
3. **Component Separation**: Each system handles one responsibility
4. **Color-coded Players**: NEON_BLUE, NEON_PINK, NEON_GREEN, NEON_YELLOW
5. **60 FPS Target**: Optimized for smooth gameplay on M3 MacBook Pro
6. **No External Dependencies**: Only Pygame required

## 🎨 Visual Design Guidelines

### Color Palette
```python
NEON_BLUE = (0, 255, 255)      # Player 1 (Left)
NEON_PINK = (255, 20, 147)     # Player 2 (Right)  
NEON_GREEN = (57, 255, 20)     # Player 3 (Top)
NEON_YELLOW = (255, 255, 0)    # Player 4 (Bottom)
NEON_PURPLE = (191, 0, 255)    # For power-ups
NEON_ORANGE = (255, 165, 0)    # For obstacles
```

### Visual Effects Standards
- **Glow effects**: Use alpha blending with larger transparent shapes
- **Trail effects**: Store position history and fade with alpha
- **Grid background**: Subtle dark cyan lines with bright center lines
- **Particle effects**: Small, short-lived colored dots for impacts

## 🚀 Development Priorities

### Immediate Next Steps (Phase 3)
1. **Create PowerUp entity class** with spawn/collection mechanics
2. **Implement paddle size power-up** (most requested feature)
3. **Add multi-ball power-up** for chaos factor
4. **Create power-up visual effects** with neon styling
5. **Integrate power-up spawning** into game loop

### Code Quality Standards
- **Clean separation**: Each file has a single responsibility
- **Consistent naming**: snake_case for functions/variables
- **Type safety**: Use proper collision detection with pygame.Rect
- **Performance**: Avoid object creation in game loop
- **Readability**: Clear variable names and comments

## 🎮 Gameplay Balance

### Current AI Difficulty Settings
- **Easy (0.1)**: No prediction/strategy, 20-frame delays, 30% slower movement, 60% accuracy
- **Medium (0.3)**: Limited prediction/strategy, 12-frame delays, 15% slower movement, 80% accuracy  
- **Hard (0.6)**: Full AI capabilities, 4-frame delays, full speed, 100% accuracy
- All AI players (Right, Top, Bottom) use the same difficulty level from settings

### Ball Physics Parameters
- Base speed: 6 pixels/frame
- Spin factor: 0.7 (affects angle change on paddle hits)
- Minimum speeds: 2 pixels/frame in each direction (prevents getting stuck)

### Power-up Balance Suggestions
- **Paddle size change**: 50% size reduction for enemies, 150% for player
- **Multi-ball duration**: 10-15 seconds
- **Power-up spawn rate**: Every 15-30 seconds
- **Effect duration**: 8-12 seconds for temporary effects

## 🔧 Technical Notes

### Performance Considerations
- Game runs at 60 FPS on M3 MacBook Pro
- Uses pygame.sprite groups for efficient collision detection
- Minimal object allocation during gameplay
- Optimized rendering with dirty rectangle updates

### Collision System
- Uses pygame.Rect for all collision detection
- Ball-paddle collisions calculate relative hit position for spin
- Wall bouncing with boundary thickness consideration
- Power-up collection uses simple rect overlap

### Settings System
- JSON persistence with `settings.json` file
- Automatic creation of defaults if file missing
- Real-time application of difficulty changes
- Validation of setting ranges and types

### AI Difficulty Implementation
- **Multi-layer difficulty system** with exponential scaling
- **Feature toggles**: Prediction and strategy disabled for Easy mode
- **Speed preservation**: Original paddle speed stored to prevent degradation
- **Accuracy modifiers**: Intentional errors injected for easier difficulties
- **Reaction scaling**: 20/12/4 frame delays for Easy/Medium/Hard

**Organization Principles:**
- **Single Responsibility**: Each file handles one specific concern
- **Modular Rendering**: UI, game elements, and effects separated into specialized renderers
- **Clear Dependencies**: Systems depend on entities and utils, renderers depend on effects
- **Extensible Design**: Easy to add new systems, entities, or rendering components
- **Testable Architecture**: Isolated systems and renderers for unit testing

## 🐛 Known Issues to Address

1. **Ball corner sticking**: Rare issue where ball gets stuck in corners
2. **Power-up balance**: Need playtesting to fine-tune effects (when implemented)
3. **Visual polish**: Some glow effects could be more dramatic
4. **Sound system**: No audio implementation yet
